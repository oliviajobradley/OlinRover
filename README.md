For the final Fundamentals of Robotics project, our team was tasked with creating a rover that could complete several autonomous missions in The O, the center courtyard of Olinâ€™s campus.

The three main challenges were: navigation of unobstructed terrain, docking in a supply station, and delivering a payload to a dropbox.
Besides this, our team decided to try and do 3 extra stretch goals: navigate through stationary obstacles, park within the medium box of the supply station, and deliver our payload to a specific dropbox using AprilTags (with a possible one being finding payloads around the O and picking those up for extra deliveries).
During our demo presentation, we were able to complete the first goals, navigation and docking. While we were not able to deliver a payload during the demo period, we did make sure we were able to complete it during our practice time.

This repository holds the [Software](Software/) and [CAD](CAD/) files required to assemble and program the Olin Planetary Rover designed by our group. It also has our [Report](Report.pdf) detailing how we designed and built the robot and eventually got it to autonomously go around the Olin O.

We have also added a [Images](imgs/) folder that includes all our photos from Demo Day.
